# Profile Language Extension

This project is for the VSCode syntax highlighting extension for the Profile language. Profiles are a proper superset of both the JSON and Java Properties formats and as such are a drop in replacement for either. Profiles provide additional functionality that is not available in either format.

Profiles are useful for any use case in which JSON or Properties are used, including system and application configuration and data transmmission and general purpose mapping and indexing.

The Profile syntax is more powerful, less complex and less error prone than JSON, Properties and YAML syntaxes, and is more user friendly.

## Features

Profiles provide additional functionality including Text Block support, single quoted strings, scoped value substitutions within string values, expressions including conditional, logical, relational, unary, multiplicative and arithmetic, and functions and shell script invocation.

<!-- Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->
